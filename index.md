# Phone Controlled Robot Arm
In Iron Man 3, we see Avenger Tony Stark work with a robot arm to perform and create new pieces of the Ironman suit. Although it may not be as advanced as Ironman's arm, the Phone Controlled Robot Arm is unique in it's own way. Through combining various apsects of mechanical,software, and electrical engineering the user can control the arm through three different modifications which include Potentiometer(s), a GUI, and Processing.

# About the Creator

Hello, I'm Meghana, and here is my portfolio, of my project I created in 3 weeks. After a lot of time, occasional tears, and effort, I've been able to create an amazing website and demo. Please Enjoy!

# Project Demo
 Here is the clip from Demo night to showcase and summarize my entire project.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was being able to connect a servo motor and control it through an APK app on my device. At first this was a tad bit difficult as I had not previously used Android devices; it was a different medium for me. I was able to use an Andorid tablet to process and dowload this app. Utilizing the HC-05 Bluetooth module, I was able to connect the servo motor through bluetooth, meaning that I could control the servo motor wirelessly. I first connected and fastened the wires to the breadboard and the arduino board. the arduino board was attached to my latop via a cable. This allowed the transfer of power originally from my laptop to my arudino board. (It was a main source of power).
